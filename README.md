# CV-mouse
 To design virtual mouse which detects  hand gestures patterns instead of physical mouse. Basically we use colored tips for detection which are captured by webcam Here, the colored fingertip acts as an object  which the web cam senses The camera is positioned such that it recognizes the  moment of finger tips and performs the operations of mouse The application has been designed to be cost effective and uses low cost input tools like webcam for capturing hand as input.
We are developing a system to control the mouse cursor using a  real-time camera. This system is based on computer vision algorithms and can do all  mouse tasks.
However, it is difficult to get stable results because of the variety of  lighting and skin colors of human races.
This system could be useful in presentations and to reduce work  space.
Various application programs can be written exclusively for this technology to create a wide range of applications with minimum requirements of resources.
